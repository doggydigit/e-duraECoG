# e-duraECoG
Functionality analysis of the e-dura flexible micro-ECoG implant for brain-computer interfaces.

Project to evaluate the use of the e-dura flexible micro-ECoG implant on mice brains during simple walking tasks over a ladder. The second README in  the Code/ folder explains how the data processing and plotting was made. However the actual data of the ECoG trials is not present because to big for upload. In case of interest please contact me directly.
The Report speaks for itself.
