The functions available in this document allow to load the results from the e-dura in vivo experiments and analyze the data in different ways. Here is an example of how this code can be used:


1. Load the Data. Note: this will only contain the trials of rat 608 and 610.

1.1. Reload the data from the text files:

>> Data=LoadAllData();

1.2. Load the data from the .mat file

>> load Data.mat


2. Plot the lowpass filtered and common average referenced ECoG signal from the first trial of the Data

2.1. If you wish, you can first tune the ECoG and EMG data.

>> example=Tune(Data(1));

2.2. Then plot the data.

>> PlotAllSignals(example);


3. Chose the data from one specific rat (for example rat 608).

>> Data608=GetMouse('608',Data);

Note: One could chose even more specific types of data using the functions "GetDay" or "GetExperiment". Extract the experiments mad on day 7 from the data of rat 608.

>> Data608P7=GetDay('P7',Data608);


4. Extract the data contained in windows around a chosen event from your set of data. For example 3 seconds window around the "stopping to run" event for rat 608 on day 7.

>> Stop608P7=GetEvents(Data608P7, 'ge_stop', 3);


5. The Spectrogram pattern from this set of data can then be made (this can take some time dependendig on the window size around the event and the amount of data given as input). Note: Do not compute the spectrogram pattern from a set of data containing trials made on day 55 since the time of occurence of the events is erroneous.

>> [Frequency, Time, StopPattern608P7]=SpectrogramPattern(Stop608);


6. Plot the computed patterns.

>> PlotSpectrogramPattern(Frequency, Time, StopPattern608P7);


7. Compute the VALs of one trial or the mean VALs of an array of trials.

>> VAL608=VAL(Data608);


8. Plot the VAL map for an electrode (for example electrode 7). Note that this will not work if the electrode was corrupted in all of the trials.

>> PlotVAL(VAL608(7,:))
